HBase is a distributed, scalable, and column-oriented database that runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide fast and random access to them. HBase can also integrate with other Hadoop components, such as MapReduce, Hive, and Pig, to perform various data processing and analysis tasks.

#### Advanced usage of HBase

HBase can be used for various advanced use cases, such as:

- Storing and querying genome sequences and disease history in the medical field 
- Storing and analyzing customer search history and target advertisement in the e-commerce field
- Storing and predicting match outcomes and statistics in the sports field
- Storing and processing large-scale graph data, such as social networks, web graphs, and recommendation systems
- Storing and aggregating time series data, such as sensor data, stock prices, and web logs

The following diagram illustrates the basic architecture of a HBase cluster:
