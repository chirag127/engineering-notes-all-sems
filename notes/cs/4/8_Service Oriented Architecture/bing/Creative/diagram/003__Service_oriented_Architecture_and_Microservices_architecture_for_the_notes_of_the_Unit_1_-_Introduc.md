### Service oriented Architecture and Microservices architecture

Service oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microservices architecture (MSA) are two common service-based architectures that rely on services as the main component of an application. Services are self-contained, discrete, and repeatable units of software that perform specific functions or tasks. Services communicate with each other through service interfaces, which are protocols that define how to exchange data and messages.

The main difference between SOA and MSA is the scope and granularity of the services. SOA has an enterprise scope, which means that it aims to reuse services across different applications and domains. SOA services are typically coarse-grained, which means that they encapsulate a large amount of business or application logic. SOA also relies on a common platform, such as an enterprise service bus (ESB), to facilitate communication and integration among services. SOA services may use different message protocols, such as SOAP, REST, or XML, to interact with each other.

MSA has an application scope, which means that it focuses on building a single application as a collection of independent and loosely coupled services. MSA services are typically fine-grained, which means that they implement a small and specific functionality. MSA also allows each service to have its own platform, such as a container, to run in its own process and environment. MSA services usually use a simple and lightweight message protocol, such as REST or JSON, to communicate with each other.

The following diagram illustrates the basic architecture of a SOA:
