### Centralized Deadlock Detection

- This is a technique used in distributed systems to handle deadlock detection.
- According to this technique, the system maintains one global wait-for graph in a single chosen site, which is named as deadlock-detection coordinator.
- The coordinator collects information about the local wait-for graphs of each site and constructs the global wait-for graph.
- The coordinator periodically runs a deadlock detection algorithm on the global wait-for graph and informs the sites about the deadlocks.
- The advantages of this technique are simplicity and efficiency.
- The disadvantages of this technique are single point of failure, communication overhead, and lack of scalability.
