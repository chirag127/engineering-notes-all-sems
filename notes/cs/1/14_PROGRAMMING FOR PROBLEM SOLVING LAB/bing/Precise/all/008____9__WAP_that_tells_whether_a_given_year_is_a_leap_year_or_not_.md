## 9. WAP that tells whether a given year is a leap year or not.

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not.

Here is an example of a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not:

```python
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4) == 0:
   if (year % 100) == 0:
       if (year % 400) == 0:
           print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
       else:
           print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
   else:
       print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))
else:
   print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))
```

This program takes a year as input from the user and checks whether it is a leap year or not using the conditions mentioned above. If the year is a leap year, it prints a message stating that the year is a leap year, otherwise, it prints a message stating that the year is not a leap year.
