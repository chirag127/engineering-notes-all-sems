## 1. WAP that accepts the marks of 5 subjects and finds the sum and percentage marks obtained by the student.

- A WAP (Write a Program) is a task that requires writing a computer program in a specific programming language to perform a certain operation or function.
- To write a WAP that accepts the marks of 5 subjects and finds the sum and percentage marks obtained by the student, we need to follow these steps:

  - Declare variables to store the marks of 5 subjects, the sum and the percentage.
  - Prompt the user to enter the marks of 5 subjects and store them in the variables.
  - Calculate the sum by adding the marks of 5 subjects.
  - Calculate the percentage by dividing the sum by the total marks (which is 500 if each subject has 100 marks) and multiplying by 100.
  - Display the sum and the percentage to the user.

- Here is an example of a WAP that accepts the marks of 5 subjects and finds the sum and percentage marks obtained by the student in Python:

```python
# Declare variables
marks1 = 0
marks2 = 0
marks3 = 0
marks4 = 0
marks5 = 0
sum = 0
percentage = 0

# Prompt the user to enter the marks of 5 subjects
marks1 = int(input("Enter the marks of subject 1: "))
marks2 = int(input("Enter the marks of subject 2: "))
marks3 = int(input("Enter the marks of subject 3: "))
marks4 = int(input("Enter the marks of subject 4: "))
marks5 = int(input("Enter the marks of subject 5: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum = marks1 + marks2 + marks3 + marks4 + marks5

# Calculate the percentage
percentage = (sum / 500) * 100

# Display the sum and the percentage
print("The sum of marks is: ", sum)
print("The percentage of marks is: ", percentage)
```
