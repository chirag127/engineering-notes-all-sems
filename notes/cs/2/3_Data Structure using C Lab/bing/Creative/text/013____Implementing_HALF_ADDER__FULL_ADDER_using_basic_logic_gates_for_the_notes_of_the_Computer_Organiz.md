## Implementing HALF ADDER, FULL ADDER using basic logic gates

- A half adder is a digital logic circuit that performs binary addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs, SUM and CARRY. The SUM output is the least significant bit (LSB) of the result, while the CARRY output is the most significant bit (MSB) of the result, indicating whether there was a carry-over from the addition.
- A full adder is a digital logic circuit that performs binary addition of three single-bit binary numbers: two inputs, A and B, and a carry-in, CIN. It has two outputs, SUM and CARRY. The SUM output is the LSB of the result, while the CARRY output is the MSB of the result, indicating whether there was a carry-over from the addition or from the previous stage.
- A half adder can be implemented using an XOR gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate produces the SUM output, while the AND gate produces the CARRY output. The truth table and the logic diagram of a half adder are shown below:

| A | B | SUM | CARRY |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |

- A full adder can be implemented using two half adders and an OR gate. The first half adder adds A and B to produce a partial SUM and a partial CARRY. The second half adder adds the partial SUM and CIN to produce the final SUM and a final CARRY. The OR gate combines the two CARRY outputs to produce the final CARRY output. The truth table and the logic diagram of a full adder are shown below:

| A | B | CIN | SUM | CARRY |
|---|---|-----|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |   1   |

- Both half and full adders are combinational logic circuits, and they both differ from each other in the aspect of input processing. Any combinational circuit is devoid of memory elements- they only comprise the logic gates. There is a primary difference between half adder and full adder: a half adder can only add two bits, while a full adder can add three bits, taking into account the carry from the previous stage.
- Half adders and full adders are the basic building blocks of arithmetic logic units (ALUs), which are used to perform arithmetic operations on binary numbers in digital systems. By cascading multiple full adders, larger adders can be constructed, such as ripple carry adders, carry look-ahead adders, and carry skip adders.
