## Implementing HALF ADDER, FULL ADDER using basic logic gates

- A half adder is a digital logic circuit that performs binary addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs, SUM and CARRY. The SUM output is the least significant bit (LSB) of the result, while the CARRY output is the most significant bit (MSB) of the result, indicating whether there was a carry-over from the addition.
- A full adder is a digital logic circuit that performs binary addition of three single-bit binary numbers: two inputs, A and B, and a carry-in, CIN. It has two outputs, SUM and CARRY. The SUM output is the LSB of the result, while the CARRY output is the MSB of the result, indicating whether there was a carry-over from the addition or from the previous stage.
- A half adder can be implemented using an XOR gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate produces the SUM output, while the AND gate produces the CARRY output. The logic diagram of a half adder is shown below:

- A full adder can be implemented using two half adders and an OR gate. The first half adder adds the inputs A and B and produces a partial SUM and a partial CARRY. The second half adder adds the partial SUM and the carry-in CIN and produces the final SUM and a final CARRY. The OR gate combines the partial CARRY and the final CARRY to produce the final CARRY output. The logic diagram of a full adder is shown below:

- The truth tables of a half adder and a full adder are shown below:

| A | B | SUM | CARRY |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |
