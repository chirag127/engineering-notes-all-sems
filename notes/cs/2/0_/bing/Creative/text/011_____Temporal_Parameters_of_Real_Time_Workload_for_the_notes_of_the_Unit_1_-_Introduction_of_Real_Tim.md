### Temporal Parameters of Real Time Workload

- A real time workload is a set of tasks or jobs that need to be executed by a real time system within certain time constraints.
- The temporal parameters of a job are the attributes that define its timing requirements and characteristics .
- The temporal parameters of a job are :
  - **Release time (r<sub>i</sub>)**: The earliest time at which a job can start execution. It may be known exactly or within a range [r<sub>i</sub><sup>-</sup>, r<sub>i</sub><sup>+</sup>] (jitter).
  - **Absolute deadline (d<sub>i</sub>)**: The latest time by which a job must finish execution. It may be hard (must be met) or soft (can be missed with some penalty).
  - **Relative deadline (D<sub>i</sub>)**: The maximum time interval between the release time and the absolute deadline of a job. It is equal to d<sub>i</sub> - r<sub>i</sub>.
  - **Feasible interval [(r<sub>i</sub>, d<sub>i</sub>)]**: The time interval in which a job can be feasibly executed by the system. It is equal to the relative deadline minus the execution time of the job.
- The temporal parameters of a job determine its urgency, priority, and schedulability in a real time system .
