"""
Algorithms are the heart of computer science. They are the recipes for solving problems.
They are the building blocks of all modern computing systems.
They take in values or a set of values called inputs and produce a value or a set of values called outputs.
Algorithmic thinking is a way of solving problems that is not limited to computers.
It is a way of thinking that can be applied to any problem-solving situation.

# Analyzing Algorithms
"""
An algorithm is a recipe for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
The computation might be something mathematical
# such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial.
Or it might be a symbolic computation
# such as searching and replacing text in a document or compiling a program.
Or it might be a physical computation
# such as modeling the weather or finding the best route through a graph.
Or it might be something else.

# Growth of Functions
"""
The growth of a function f(n) is a function that describes how f(n) behaves as the value of n increases.

There are two common ways to describe the growth of a function.

1. Asymptotic notation
2. Order of growth

Asymptotic notation describes the growth of a function as the value of n increases without regard to the constant factors.
Order of growth describes the growth of a function as the value of n increases while ignoring the lower order terms.

Asymptotic notation is a way of describing the growth of a function as the value of n increases without regard to the constant factors.
Order of growth is a way of describing the growth of a function as the value of n increases while ignoring the lower order terms.

The most common asymptotic notations are:

1. O-notation
2. Ω-notation
3. Θ-notation

O-notation describes the set of functions that grow more slowly than a specified function.
Ω-notation describes the set of functions that grow more quickly than a specified function.
Θ-notation describes the set of functions that grow at the same rate as a specified function.

The most common order of growth functions are:

1. Constant
2. Logarithmic
3. Linear
4. N log N
5. Quadratic
6. Cubic

# Heap Sort
"""
Heap Sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.

What is Binary Heap?
Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible (Source Wikipedia)

A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is called as max heap and the latter is called min heap. The heap can be represented by binary tree or array.

Why array based representation for Binary Heap?
Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as array and array based representation is space efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).

What is Binary Heap used for?
Heaps are used for priority queue operations, and in graph traversal algorithms like Prim’s and Dijkstra’s.

How to build the heap?

Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom up order.

Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order:
1. Build a max heap from the input data.
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of tree.

3. Repeat above steps while size of heap is greater than 1.

Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in decreasing order:
1. Build a min heap from the input data.
2. At this point, the smallest item is stored at the root
of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap
followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally,
heapify the root of tree.

"""
The sorting algorithm is based on counting sort that assumes that the input is composed of k different integers in the range [0, k-1].


The idea is to first create a count array to store the number of occurrences of each element in the input array. Next, we modify the count array such that each element at each index stores the sum of previous counts. This step gives us the position of each element in the output array. Finally, we iterate over the input array, get the count at each index from the count array, and place the element at the correct position in the output array. The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in input array and k is the range of input.
