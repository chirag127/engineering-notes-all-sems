# Optimality of Effective-Deadline-First (EDF) and Least-Slack-Time-First (LST) Algorithms

- EDF and LST are two dynamic priority scheduling algorithms used in real-time systems.
- EDF assigns priorities to tasks according to their absolute deadlines. The task with the earliest deadline has the highest priority and is executed first.
- LST assigns priorities to tasks according to their slacks. The slack of a task is the difference between its deadline and its remaining execution time. The task with the least slack has the highest priority and is executed first.
- EDF and LST are optimal only when they always produce a feasible schedule if one exists. A feasible schedule is one that meets all the deadlines of the tasks.
- EDF is optimal for preemptive scheduling of periodic and sporadic tasks with arbitrary deadlines and no precedence constraints. This means that EDF can schedule any set of tasks that is schedulable by any other algorithm.
- LST is optimal for preemptive scheduling of periodic and sporadic tasks with arbitrary deadlines and precedence constraints. This means that LST can schedule any set of tasks that is schedulable by any other algorithm that respects the precedence constraints.
- However, EDF and LST are not optimal for non-preemptive scheduling or for tasks with shared resources or synchronization requirements. In these cases, EDF and LST may fail to produce a feasible schedule even if one exists.
