### DDL for the notes of the Unit 5 - Structured Query Language (SQL) in the subject of Basics of Data Base Management System

- DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL commands that are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, schemas, etc.
- DDL commands do not affect the data stored in the database, but only the structure or schema of the database.
- Some of the common DDL commands are:

  - CREATE: This command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, etc. For example, `CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name VARCHAR(50), age INT);` creates a new table named students with three columns: id, name, and age.
  - ALTER: This command is used to modify an existing database object, such as adding, dropping, or renaming columns, changing data types, adding constraints, etc. For example, `ALTER TABLE students ADD email VARCHAR(50);` adds a new column named email to the students table.
  - DROP: This command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table, view, index, etc. For example, `DROP TABLE students;` deletes the students table and all the data stored in it.
  - RENAME: This command is used to change the name of an existing database object, such as a table, view, index, etc. For example, `RENAME TABLE students TO learners;` changes the name of the students table to learners.
  - TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all the data from an existing table, but not the table itself. For example, `TRUNCATE TABLE students;` deletes all the rows from the students table, but the table structure remains intact.
- DDL commands are normally executed by database administrators or developers, who have the necessary permissions to create and modify the database schema. DDL commands are not used by general users, who should access the database through an application or a query interface.
