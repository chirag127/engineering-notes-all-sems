## Program for Quick Sort for the notes of the Design and Analysis of Algorithm Lab in the subject of Real Time System

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The function then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

Here is an example of a Quick Sort program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int* a, int* b)
{
    int t = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = t;
}

int partition (int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = (low - 1);

    for (int j = low; j <= high- 1; j++)
    {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot)
        {
            i++;
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
        }
    }
    swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
    return (i + 1);
}

void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high)
{
    if (low < high)
    {
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
    int i;
    for (i=0; i < size; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    printf("\n");
}

int main()
{
    int arr[] = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    quickSort(arr, 0, n-1);
    printf("Sorted array: \n");
    printArray(arr, n);
    return 0;
}
```

This program first includes the necessary libraries and defines a `swap` function to swap two elements. The `partition` function takes the array, the starting index, and the ending index as arguments and partitions the array around the pivot element. The `quickSort` function recursively sorts the sub-arrays and the `printArray` function prints the sorted array.

The `main` function initializes the array to be sorted and calls the `quickSort` function. The sorted array is then printed using the `printArray` function.

Quick Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). It is an efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets. However, its performance can degrade if the pivot element is not chosen wisely. It is also not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.
