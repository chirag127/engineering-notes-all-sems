### Quadric surfaces

- Quadric surfaces are common modeling primitives for a variety of computer graphics and computer-aided-design applications .
- Quadric surfaces are the graphs of equations that can be expressed in the form `Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Jz + K = 0`.
- Quadric surfaces are the 3D counterparts of conic sections and have six distinct types:
  - Ellipsoid: a surface described by an equation of the form `x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1`. It is a closed surface that resembles a stretched sphere.
  - Elliptic paraboloid: a surface described by an equation of the form `z = x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2`. It is an open surface that resembles a parabolic bowl.
  - Hyperbolic paraboloid: a surface described by an equation of the form `z = x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2`. It is an open surface that resembles a saddle.
  - Hyperboloid of one sheet: a surface described by an equation of the form `x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = 1`. It is an open surface that resembles a double cone with a waist.
  - Hyperboloid of two sheets: a surface described by an equation of the form `x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = 1`. It is a closed surface that consists of two disjoint pieces.
  - Cone: a surface described by an equation of the form `x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 = 0`. It is an open surface that resembles a pointed hat.
- Quadric surfaces can be rendered using ray tracing or ray firing, which is a method of simulating the interaction of light rays with the surface .
- Quadric surfaces can also be transformed using matrix operations, such as translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing.
- Quadric surfaces can be classified using the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the quadratic terms. The number and sign of the nonzero eigenvalues determine the type of the quadric surface.
