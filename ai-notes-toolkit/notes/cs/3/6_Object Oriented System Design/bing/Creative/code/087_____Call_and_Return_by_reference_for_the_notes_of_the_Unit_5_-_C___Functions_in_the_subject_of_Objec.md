### Call and Return by Reference

- Call by reference is a technique of passing arguments to a function in which the actual memory addresses of the arguments are passed to the function.
- This means that any changes made to the parameters inside the function will affect the original variables in the caller function.
- To pass an argument by reference, we use the `&` operator before the parameter name in the function declaration and definition.
- For example, `void swap(int &a, int &b)` is a function that takes two integers by reference and swaps their values.
- Return by reference is a technique of returning a value from a function in which the function returns a reference (or a pointer) to a variable instead of a copy of the variable.
- This means that the caller function can access and modify the returned variable directly, without creating a new variable.
- To return a value by reference, we use the `&` operator before the return type in the function declaration and definition.
- For example, `int &max(int &a, int &b)` is a function that returns a reference to the larger of the two integers passed by reference.
- Call and return by reference are useful for improving the performance and efficiency of the program, as they avoid copying large or complex data structures.
- They also allow the function to modify the arguments and return values without using pointers or global variables.
- However, they also have some drawbacks, such as the risk of dangling references, memory leaks, or undefined behavior if the referenced variables go out of scope or are deleted.
