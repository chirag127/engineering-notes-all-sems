### Logical clocks for the notes of the Unit 1 - Characterization of Distributed Systems in the subject of DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM

- A logical clock is a mechanism for capturing chronological and causal relationships in a distributed system  .
- A distributed system may have no physically synchronous global clock, so a logical clock allows global ordering on events from different processes in such systems .
- A logical clock is not a physical device, but a software counter that is incremented according to some rules .
- Logical clocks are useful in computation analysis, distributed algorithm design, individual event tracking, and exploring computational progress.
- Some noteworthy logical clock algorithms are:
  - Lamport timestamps, which are monotonically increasing software counters that are updated based on the send and receive events of messages .
  - Vector clocks, which are arrays of software counters that are updated based on the send, receive, and local events of processes .
  - Matrix clocks, which are matrices of software counters that are updated based on the send, receive, and local events of processes and also capture the concurrency of events.
- Logical clocks can provide a partial or total ordering of events in a distributed system, depending on the algorithm used .
- Logical clocks can also be used to implement other distributed system concepts, such as mutual exclusion, deadlock detection, snapshot, and causal broadcast .
