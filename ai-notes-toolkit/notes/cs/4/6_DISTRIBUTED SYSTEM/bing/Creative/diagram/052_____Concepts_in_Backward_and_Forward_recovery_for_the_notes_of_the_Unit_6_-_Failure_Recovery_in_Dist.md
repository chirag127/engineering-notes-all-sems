### Concepts in Backward and Forward Recovery

- Backward recovery and forward recovery are two techniques for restoring the system to a consistent state after a failure in a distributed system.
- Backward recovery involves rolling back the system to a previous error-free state by using checkpoints and logs. Forward recovery involves correcting the errors and continuing the execution from the current state.
- The main difference between backward and forward recovery is that backward recovery discards the work done after the error, while forward recovery preserves the work done before and after the error.
- Backward recovery is more general and independent of the nature of faults, but it may incur more overhead and latency. Forward recovery is more efficient and responsive, but it requires accurate assessment and removal of errors.
- Some examples of backward recovery protocols are checkpointing, logging, and message logging. Some examples of forward recovery protocols are redundancy, replication, and voting.
