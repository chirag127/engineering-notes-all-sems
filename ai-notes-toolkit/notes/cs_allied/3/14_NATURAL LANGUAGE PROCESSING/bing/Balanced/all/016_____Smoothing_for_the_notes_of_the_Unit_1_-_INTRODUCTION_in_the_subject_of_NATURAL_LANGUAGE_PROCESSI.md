# Smoothing

- Smoothing is the process of flattening a probability distribution implied by a language model so that all reasonable word sequences can occur with some probability .
- Smoothing often involves broadening the distribution by redistributing weight from high probability regions to zero probability regions .
- Smoothing is very important in natural language processing, as some words may have zero or close to zero probabilities such as the out-of-vocabulary words (words that do not exist in the vocabulary), but the same rare words may not have the same values in test data.
- Smoothing techniques in NLP are used to address scenarios related to determining probability / likelihood estimate of a sequence of words (say, a sentence) occurring together when one or more words individually (unigram) or N-grams such as bigram (w i / w i − 1) or trigram (w i / w i − 1 w i − 2) in the given set have never occurred in the past.
- Smoothing can help performance whenever data sparsity is an issue, and data sparsity is almost always an issue in statistical modeling.
- Smoothing can also allow expanding the model, such as by moving to a higher n-gram model, to capture more complex dependencies.
- Some examples of smoothing techniques are add-one smoothing, add-k smoothing, Good-Turing smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing, etc.
